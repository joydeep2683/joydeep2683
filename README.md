A computer vision enginner with current primary focus in deep learning and image processing. Skilled in Python and Pytorch. Worked on concepts like classification, object detection, face detection & face recognition and object segmentation.

Secondarily, to build pipeline for these products I did software engineering to make those products up and running.
